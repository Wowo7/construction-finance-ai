Hi, I was so curious about this project so I went ahead and built it.

It's a working Next.js 15 + Supabase + AI chat prototype with 5 AI tools that query construction budget data through Supabase RPC functions. The assistant can break down budgets by trade, compare projects, find overspent packages, and drill into specific line items - all in plain English. I loaded 3 demo projects (Downtown Office Tower $28.5M, Riverside Medical $42M, Lakewood Elementary $8.2M) with realistic financial data so you can test it right away.

I've tested it and it's working. You can follow my README.md for installation. Let me know if we can work together to refine any details. Thank you

Gin
